# üßë‚ÄçüöÄ Hello, Astronaut!

Welcome to the official [Astro](https://astro.build/) + [TinaCMS](https://tina.io/) starter template! This template serves as a lightweight, minimally-styled starting point for anyone looking to build a personal website, blog, or portfolio with Astro and TinaCMS.

This template comes with a few integrations already configured in your `astro.config.mjs` file. You can customize this further with [Astro Integrations](https://astro.build/integrations) to add tools like Tailwind to your project.

Here are a few ideas on how to get started with the template:

* **Edit this page**: Navigate to `/admin` to update your homepage content in TinaCMS or manually edit `src/pages/index.astro` for full control.
* **Site Header**: Customize the navigation items in TinaCMS under the **Config Collection** or via `src/components/Header.astro`.
* **Site Footer**: Make it yours by adding your name or details in TinaCMS Global Config.
* **Explore Blog Posts**: Check out sample posts in `src/content/blog` to see how content is structured or edit them in TinaCMS under the **Blog Collection**.
* **Layout Customization**: Update the blog post page layout in `src/layouts/BlogPost.astro` for a unique look.

Have fun! If you get stuck, remember to check out the [Astro documentation](https://docs.astro.build/en/getting-started/) or [TinaCMS documentation](https://tina.io/docs) for guidance. You can also join the [TinaCMS Discord](https://discord.com/invite/zumN63Ybpf) community to ask questions and connect with other users.
